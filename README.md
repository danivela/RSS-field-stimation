# Description
This code is focused on the application of a certain ML algorithms in a specific scenario in order to estimate the received signal strength (RSS) at differents point in that scenario, from the information provided by low-cost sensors whose measurements have a very low precise. The selected ML algorithm is Gaussian Processes for Regression (GPR) and the code is implemented in Python3.6. The theoretical background is based on the following project: "Recursive Estimation of Dynamic RSS Fields Based of Crowdsourcing and Gaussiand Processes" which authors are: Irene Santos, Juan José Murillo-Fuentes and Petar M. Djuric.

# Steps to execute the algorithm
1. First of all, install the necessary libraries in a virtual environment. For that, use the requirements.txt file uploaded on this project.
