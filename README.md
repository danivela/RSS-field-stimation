# Description
This code is focused on the application of a certain ML algorithms in a specific scenario in order to estimate the received signal strength (RSS) at differents point in that scenario, from the information provided by low-cost sensors whose measurements have a very low precise. The selected ML algorithm is Gaussian Processes for Regression (GPR) and the code is implemented in Python3.6. The theoretical background is based on the following project: "Recursive Estimation of Dynamic RSS Fields Based of Crowdsourcing and Gaussiand Processes" which authors are: Irene Santos, Juan Jos√© Murillo-Fuentes and Petar M. Djuric.

# Steps to execute the algorithm
1. First of all, install the necessary libraries in a virtual environment. For that, use the requirements.txt file uploaded on this project.
2. Then, examine the main file (principal.py), specially the lines from 40-59. These lines describe the flags to execute the different scenario developed for this project. Mainly, to execute the usual scenario to static field (the sensores are always in the same position) along with the time, you shall select the option '1' in the first position in line 58 and the option '1' in the third position. On the other hand, if you want to analyze the recursive scenario, you shall set the option '2' in the first position and the option '1' in the fourth position. The remaining paramaters can be set by default or you can change to study the different scenarios. The whole set of flags are described below:
   - Scenario: Used scenario ('1', '2' or '3'). 
     1. The sensors are always in the same position.
     2. The sensors are moving in each instant. 
     3. The sensors are always static but the are not always transmitting.
   - flag_tx_est: The transmitter position is stimated ('1' or '0').
   - flagGPstatic: The GPR algorithm is used for static scenario ('1' or '0').
   - flagGPrecursive: The GPR algorithm is used for recursive scenario ('1' or '0').
   - flagOKD: The algorithm OKD is used for recursive scenario ('1' or '0'). See the reference to inspect the algorithm.
   - flagGholami: The algorithm Gholami is used for recursive scenario ('1' or '0'). See the reference to inspect the algorithm.
   - flagWatcharapan: The algorithm Watcharapan is used for recursive scenario ('1' or '0'). See the reference to inspect the algorithm.
   - flagfigs: Choose if the figures are depicted or not ('1' or '0').
   - flagdisp: The kernel hiperparameters are stimated and shown ('1' or '0').
   - flagGridFix: The node position are fixed ('1' or '0').
   - optimiseHyperparameters: The kernel hyperparameters are stimated or not ('True' or 'False').
   - GPRegression: The used model is GP for regression ('1' or '0').
   - GPRegression_inducing: The used model is GP for regression with inducing inputs ('1' or '0')
3. Save the generated graphics and analize the result.
